### Procedure

#### a) Circuit formulation:<br>

Connect the diode bridge network with Input and output.<br>
I.	Drag one terminal of auto-transformer and connect it with first leg of diode bridge and second terminal with the second leg of diode bridge.<br>
II.	Similarly, connect the load with the given terminals of diode bridge network.<br>

#### b) Principle of operation of the bridge rectifier: Diode bridge circuit operates in two modes as given below:<br>

I.	In positive half cycle, the diodes ‘D<sub>1</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>2</sub>’ are conducting while the diodes: D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4</sub> are in blocking state.<br>
II.	Similarly, for negative half cycle ‘D<sub>3</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>4</sub>’ are conducting while the diodes ‘D<sub>1</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>2</sub>’ are in blocking state.<br>

#### c)	Performance analysis of the circuit:<br>

I.	Select the value of Load resistance (R) and Load inductance (L) out of three choices given.<br>
II.	With selected values of load (R and L), the filter capacitor (C<sub>f</sub>) value is calculated.<br>
III.	Now, decide the ripple factor (how much ripple in output voltage can be allowed) and final calculate the filter inductor (L<sub>f</sub>).<br>
IV.	After deciding the parameters, vary the “Source Voltage (v<sub>ac</sub>)” in steps.<br>
V.	Press “RECORD” button to fill the table of observations.<br>
VI.	To observe various performance characteristics, select the parameter “icons” and then press “PLOT” icon.<br>
VII.	Repeat the above steps to observe various other performance characteristics with different values.<br>
